The eegR package has been developed to analyze EEG (or MEG) signals. It provides all basic functionalities such as data import, filtering, ICA, channel interpolation, re-referencing, segmenting, time-frequency decomposition, complex visualization and statistical analysis of single-trial and averaged ERPs. However, instead of being a comprehensive tool, it has been developed to serve mainly as a general frame which is highly extendable by other, more specialized analytic methods.

## Pre-processing 

Under pre-processing, we mean the workflow which starts with the import of a raw EEG (or MEG) file and ends up with segmented, "cleaned" signals for each participant.
