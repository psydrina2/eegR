Description: The eegR package has been developed to process
    electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This is only a pre-alpha version
    which has basic support for pre-processing EEG signals and provides
    some more advanced tools to plot and analyze averaged event related
    potentials (ERPs).
    The whole API will change in the short term so do not rely on this package
    in any form (yet).
Depends:
    R (>= 3.0.0)
